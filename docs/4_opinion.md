## Good Software Engineers

### Are Lazy

Never perform the same task more than once: Automate Everything

### Are Antisocial

Avoid as many conversations as possible: Document everything

### Know how to communicate

About their work, to a fifth grader, to their mom, to a PhD, to their girlfriend/boyfriend, to their CEO, to
Undergrads

### Don't do anything for themselves

Code exists to solve a problem, not to look good

### Are pedantic, and focus on semantics

Code isn't real, it's completely made up. If someone fails to communicate a concept, their code will be
misunderstood.
