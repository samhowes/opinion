# Code Reviews

[Code Reviews](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/), usually done via [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), are perhaps the most important part of the DevOps lifecyle. 

1. They give you the opportunity to get your mistakes fixed by others
2. They allow others to understand your work
3. They allow you to share the burden of fixing bugs in your code
