# Positive Traits of Software Engineers

A good Software Engineer is lazy, antisocial, is only capable of talking to a fifth grader, and can't get anything done
by themselves.

## Laziness

Never perform the same task more than once: Automate Everything. 

Humans are guaranteed to make mistakes, therefore any process done by a human has a high potential for error. 

## Antisocial

Avoid as many conversations as possible: Document everything. Any information conveyed in a conversation is limited to
the people present for that conversation. An engineer's time is worth a lot of money. Money should not be spent without
proper planning and understanding of where that money is going.

> **Nothing is decided until it is written down.** 

## Simple Communication

Proper documentation is written such that
a [fifth grader can understand it, without jargon](https://bazel.build/contribute/docs-style-guide#principles). Software
Engineers must interact with all kinds of people in many disciplines: Sales, Support, Management, Customers, CEO's,
their Mom, their boyfriend/girlfriend, and children.

Almost all people a Software Engineer interacts with are educated on another topic, and want things to "simply work"
without needing a degree in Computer Science to interact with a Software Engineer's work.

Encapsulation is critical to communication: users are trying to accomplish their own task, they are not trying to
understand your task.
> **What does this car do? It takes you where you want to go**

## Can't do anything by themselves

Work must be reviewed for mistakes.

> **"I must have made a mistake somewhere, please help me find it"**

## Pedanticism

Code isn't real, it's completely made up. If someone fails to communicate a concept, their code will be
misunderstood.

## Summary

A good Software Engineer automates everything, will only work on formally documented work requests, speaks simply, so
all can understand, and makes sure their work is reviewed before it is relied upon.
