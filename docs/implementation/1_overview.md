# Overview

## What was missing

1. Code sharing: Source control practices (monoreo vs manyrepo)
2. Confidence in code changes: Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests, and the testing pyramid)
3. Work item tracking (Azure DevOps)
4. Agile Project Management (estimation of work, velocity, backlog prioritization)
5. Separation of concerns (what people really mean when they say “microservices”)
6. Consistency: General automation (automated builds, releases, and systems integration)
7. Good tools:
    1. Licenced IDEs (JetBrains IntelliJ), Modern Languages (Just say "no" to Java)
8. Cohesive Documentation: Embed Documentation in Code
