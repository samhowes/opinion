# "Go away Bob, I'm busy"
> **Bob gives you a spot-bonus of $10K for being a good engineer**

Congratulations, Bob was just testing you. Bob was making sure that you were being disciplined and that you were adhering to the team's process. 

Bob knows that you aren't being a jerk, he knows that he needs to create a new [work item in the backlog instead of talking to you](../reference/good_software_engineer.md#antisocial).

Bob also knows that you just got out of your [backlog grooming meeting](../reference/agile/components.md#grooming) yesterday, and this work item was not listed in the backlog.

Bob also knows that the finance department has been begging for other features for weeks, and desperately need the project you are currently working on for the audit that is coming in two weeks. 

> Bob knows that **Any distraction from your current work will delay the timelines of the projects you already have**.
