## Restoring the previous version

Sam redeploys the last official version through the automated system.

## The dashboard goes down again

Josh changed something that broke the automated release.

Sam logs into the server to find that Josh toggled a setting that the automation depended on. Sam toggles the setting
and redeploys.

# Final Results

Sam spends the rest of the day On-Call for the CFO to mitigate the many issues that resulted. Sam's day is wasted, and
Josh's mistake caused the finance department to lose money.
