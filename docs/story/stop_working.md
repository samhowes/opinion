# "I can't finish this until Sam gets back"

> **Bob gives you a spot-bonus of $4K for being a good engineer**

Congratulations, Bob was just testing you. Bob was making sure that you were being disciplined and that you were
adhering to the team's process.

Bob doesn't think
you [aren't capable of dong work yourself](../reference/good_software_engineer.md#cant-do-anything-by-themselves), Bob
just knows that [work review](../reference/code_reviews.md), and [backlog grooming](../reference/agile/components.md#backlog) help
define the work that needs to be done.

Bob knows you are a capable developer and write good code, but he also knows that everyone makes mistakes, and that
making good software is really hard. 

> Bob is glad you want Sam's review before pushing to production.
