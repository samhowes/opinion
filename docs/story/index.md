# A Typical Day At Work

## Your name is Josh

It's Monday. You are a Software Engineer named Josh. Your coworker, Sam, has been out on vacation since last week, and
won't be in until next Monday.

Sam is a [good Software Engineer](../reference/good_software_engineer.md), so you aspire to be more like him.

> The names in this story are completely fictional. Any resemblance to real people or characters is by coincidence only.

You've heard Sam talk about [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) a lot, but you're not entirely sure
what all the hype is about: You like working on new features instead of overhead of development.

You are making good progress on a project that you are excited about, and it should be done in "a couple weeks", so your
morale is high.

## Bob is your Manager

Bob is your manager. You have a good relationship with Bob, you're still learning his full history of work and motivations
though.

It's getting to the end of the quarter, and Bob has told you that he has some spot-bonus money that he is going to give
away soon. You're hoping to get the $10K for doing good work.
