# A Typical Day At Work

## You are Josh

It's Monday. You are a Software Engineer named Josh. Your coworker, Sam, has been out on vacation since last week, and won't be in until next Monday.  

Sam is a [good Software Engineer](../reference/good_software_engineer.md), so you aspire to be more like him.

> The names in this story are completely fictional. Any resemblance to real people or characters is by coincidence only.

You are making good progress on a project that you are excited about, and it should be done in "a couple weeks", so your morale is high.

## Bob is your Manager

Bob is your manager. You have good report with Bob, you're still learning his full history of work and motivations though.
