# "Don't bother me until you've created a work item, Bob"

Congratulations, Bob was just testing you. Bob was making sure that you were being disciplined and that you were
adhering to the team's [agile process](../reference/agile/components.md#backlog).

Bob knows that the simple practice of documenting work benefits everyone:

1. It formally records what should be done
2. It documents the interpretation of the client's needs
3. It allows people to ask "What happened and why did it happen?"
