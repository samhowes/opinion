# (Manually) Deploying to Production

You take about 30 minutes to gather the files together, log in to the production server, and copy-paste the binaries directly onto the sever.

You email the finance department that the feature is deployed.

**Job Done.**

You go back to working on your original task.

## Oops
Finance emails you back saying the dashboard is down, and they can't do anything.

This happens often, it's usually a pretty trivial thing. 

## What do you do next?
1. [Redeploy the old version](./redeploy.md)
2. [Log into the server and fix it manually](./fixing_production.md)
