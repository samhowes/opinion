# Putting out the Fire

You log into the production server. You find a setting on the server that you don't understand: It should be turned off,
but it's on. You have no idea why it's off, so you turn it on and restart the server.

The dashboard works again, so you email finance.

**Job done.**

You should definitely tell Sam about what you did so he's on the same page.

You could create a new work item for him to do, that would increase his official workload in the sprint though, and you
don't want Sam to be overloaded with work items.

## How do you tell Sam?

1. [Create a work item for Sam](./create_a_work_item.md)
2. [Write yourself a sticky note to tell Sam on Monday](./sticky_note.md)
