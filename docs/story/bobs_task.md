# Bob's Task

You see Bob walking to your desk. He seems to be in a good mood, but it looks like he has something on his mind.

> **Bob: "Hi Josh, the finance department needs an update to their dashboard and they want it done in a couple hours."**

## How do you respond?

1. ["Go away Bob, I'm busy"](./go_away.md)
2. ["Sure thing, Boss, I'll start on that right now"](./sure_thing.md)
