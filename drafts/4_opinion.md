## Good Software Engineers:
1. Are Lazy
   1. Never perform the same task more than once: Automate Everything
2. Are Antisocial
   1. Avoid as many conversations as possible: Document everything
3. Know how to communicate
   1. About their work, to a fifth grader, to their mom, to a PhD, to their girlfriend/boyfriend, to their CEO, to Undergrads
4. Don't do anything for themselves
   1. Code exists to solve a problem, not to look good
5. Are pedantic, and focus on semantics
   1. Code isn't real, it's completely made up. If someone fails to communicate a concept, their code will be misunderstood.
