# Implementation: Agile Project Management

"The best tool is the tool that you use best"

> Opinion: Make [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) the tool that you use best

## Alternatives to Azure DevOps
1. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
   1. Opinion: Far too customizable and complicated. Work Item tracking should simply be "New, Active, Closed"
   2. ["Keep It Simple, Stupid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle): Work item tracking should not involve a complex state machine

2. [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues)
   1. Opinion: Far too simple for anything other than small projects. 
   2. Work Items need to be just more than "Open" and "Closed" with a chain of comments

3. [Asana](https://asana.com/) 
   1. Opinion: Work item tracking needs to be integrated with Source Control 
   2. Asana has long task Ids, which are hard to remember and reference from code
